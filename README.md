This repository demonstrates a common error in Perl: accessing an array element beyond its defined bounds. The `bug.pl` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.pl` shows the corrected version.  The error can lead to unexpected behavior or program crashes.  Always check array indices before accessing elements to avoid this problem.
